1. We are going to start off today's tutorial with a Kahoot. It will start off with some revision of Week 1 content to jog your memory and then we will revise through last week's lectures. If you want to revise in the future, the link is below!

2. What is a constant?

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

A constant is a value that cannot be changed during the program. For example, you can't add 1 to a constant, but you can to an int variable.

To create one, we use the following syntax:

```
#define CONSTANT_NAME constant_value
```

Notice there are no semi-colons and no equal signs.

Now, when we compile the code, the compiler will replace every instance of CONSTANT_NAME with constant_value, and then convert it to machine code.

3. What are if statements?

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

If statements introduce decisions into your code.

Consider the scenario where you are on a path.

If there's a single path to follow, there are no if statements.

If there's a path on the side that circles back to where you are, that's one if statement.

If there's a fork in the path, that's an if statement and an else statement.

If there are multiple branches in the path, that's an if statement, many else-if statements and an else statement.

4. Let's make the program in `age.c` take in a varying age based on user input!

<br>

**Leap Year Example**

Problem: The user gives us the year *year* and we have to tell the user if it's a leap year or not.

5. Let's plan our code!

6. Let's write our code!

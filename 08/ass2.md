# Assignment 2 Notes

Just like assignment 1, it is split into five stages - the first one being the easiest and the fifth one being the most difficult.

Recommended steps:
1. Read everything from start to end.
2. Focus on the first stage.
3. Perform tests for the first stage - compare with `1511 pokedex reference` and run autotests.
4. Make sure everything works for the first stage.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 with as many stages as you want.

**Make sure your code works for previous stages before moving on to next stages. Especially in this assignment because your next stage's code does rely on previous stages' code.**

Tips:
- Don't look at any `.c` files but the `.c` files you can change (`pokedex.c`).
- Definitely look at the `.h` files. The `.h` files are everything you need (`pokedex.h`, `pokemon.h`, `pokemon_types.h`, `ext_save.h`).
- To open multiple files, you can use the *. Eg. `gedit *.c &` opens all the `.c` files in your current directory.

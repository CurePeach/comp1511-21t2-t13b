Structs are kind of like a bag.

Ints, doubles and chars can only hold one value but structs can hold many.

While arrays can only store multiple things of the same type, structs can hold multiple things of the same or different types.

    <summary>Answer</summary>

Linked lists are most similar to arrays. They hold multiple values.

The big difference between linked lists and everything else we've seen is that there is no concrete type for it. It is abstract so we have to think of it in our minds rather than writing a variable like `list list = NULL`.

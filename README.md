Hi hi everyone!

On this page, you will find tutorial notes and examples from class. The notes will be uploaded after the tutorial so you can access them in the lab. So feel free to bookmark this page. Below is a copy of the class email I sent at the beginning of the term because this important information will be relevant for the entire term if you ever forget.

Some other important information which is in some easily digestable dot points:

- The course website IS NOT Moodle and IS NOT Webcms3 like in previous terms. The course website is found at this link: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T2/. All the course information is here including the course outline, lecture slides and your marks.
- What we do use Moodle for are our online tutorials and labs. To access them, follow these steps.
1. Head to the COMP1511 Moodle page.
2. There will be a link named Blackboard Collaborate -- Tutorials; Labs; Help-Sessions, click on it. 
3. Click on the folder named T13B (Tue) Week 1-5, 7-10 Clarissa Tatang+Patrick Chambers.
4. Click on the session for that week which will be typically highlighted in bold or you can tell from the date in the second line of text of each box.
- It is 100% okay if you don't have prior knowledge of programming! This course doesn't expect you to have any prior knowledge, and we will be there if you want some extra help.

Some things I want you guys to do:

- Try to set up home computing using the guides on the course website. You can try navigating to the home computing guides yourself or use this handy link: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T2/resources/home_computing.html. If you can't do it/struggle, we will help you in the lab, no worries!
- Join the course forum if you haven't yet! COMP1511 uses Discourse as our forum and you can join by logging in here: https://discourse.cse.unsw.edu.au/21t2/comp1511/.
